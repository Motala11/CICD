### What?
A CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery) pipeline is a set of automated processes that help teams deliver software changes more frequently and reliably. It involves building, testing, and deploying code changes automatically. Here's a quick breakdown:
- Continuous Integration (CI): This part involves automatically building and testing code changes whenever a developer commits code to a shared repository. It helps identify issues early in the development process.
- Continuous Delivery (CD): This part focuses on automating the deployment of tested code to production or staging environments. The goal is to ensure that software can be released quickly, safely, and frequently. <br> <br>

### Why?
Implementing a CI/CD pipeline offers several benefits:
- Faster Feedback: Developers receive immediate feedback on code changes, reducing integration issues.
- Consistency: Automated builds and tests ensure consistent quality across different environments.
- Reduced Risk: Automated deployments minimize human error, making releases more reliable and safer.
- Faster Time to Market: Streamlined processes enable quicker delivery of new features and bug fixes. <br> <br>

### When?
A CI/CD pipeline is beneficial in any software development project, especially in scenarios where:
- Multiple developers are working on the same codebase.
- Rapid deployment of features and bug fixes is essential.
- Consistent and reliable builds are needed across different environments.
- Testing needs to be automated to ensure code quality.

### How?
Implementing a CI/CD pipeline involves several steps:
- Source Control Management: Use version control systems like Git to manage code changes.
- Automated Builds: Set up tools like Jenkins, Travis CI, or GitLab CI to automatically build your application whenever code changes are pushed.
- Automated Testing: Integrate unit tests, integration tests, and other automated tests into your pipeline to ensure code quality.
- Artifact Management: Store build artifacts in a repository like Nexus or Artifactory.
- Continuous Deployment: Automate the deployment process using tools like Kubernetes, Docker, or AWS Lambda to deploy applications to staging or production environments.
- Monitoring and Feedback: Integrate monitoring tools to track application performance and provide feedback to developers.
